**MICRO CHALLENGE II** 

The main idea is to develop a safe and inclusive space for discussing the use of psychoactive substances. Through a physical installation and a complementary VR experience, users can share their personal experiences anonymously and learn from others' stories in a controlled environment. Our aim is to foster an immersive and collaborative dialogue on this topic.
We wanna help people to communicate their opinion and experiences about drugs in a way that can allow them to feel comfortable in sharing personal opinions and experiences. 

During the micro challenge II we developed the physical installation called "The Confessional". We're developing the VR indipendently.
The Confessional is a wood structure (CnC, lasercut) that can host one person at a time. It's not supposed to fully cover the person, cause we don't believe in shame or guilt in drug assumption, but just to isolate in order to create a personal space that helps a flow of thoughs. As the user walks in, a blu led turns on and the recording starts. 
We give people 100 seconds to share their experience, the limit of time is needed because the recordings are then gonna be used in the VR immersive installation. 



*REFERENCES*

- STRUCTURE: The whole idea is based on the concept or implement the dialogue about drug consuption as hard reduction method. The "Dutch way", liberal and open minded, was our main inspiration. The lack of communication and dialogue brings a huge lack of awareness and information in the topic itself. Also, sharing personal experiences can prevent harm to other people.
The traditional confessionals are a space for people to tell their sins to a priest, be listened and receive holy forgivness. We transalted this to modern concept, where there's no priest listening to you but yourself, and a microphone that records.

Since that we are a group or two, we decided to devide the tasks: 
- physical structure: we already had the CnC and laser cut parts. Since that we're planning to move the structure around, we have to make it removable cause it would be too heavy to carry around as one whole piece. We're gonna use screws but we don't want to ruin the wood, so we decided to 3D print support pieces for the planks with inserters for the screws.
- rasbperry pi and python to program the fuction or light, recording and distance, using a LED, a ultrasonic distance detector and a microphone. 






# **PHYSICAL STRUCTURE**

Material needed: 
- plywood 4mm (lasercut)
- wood 15mm (CnC) 
- 3D printed plastic junctions
- screws

We first designed together the physical structure on Rhino, struggling with the quantity of material that we had available and the average sizes of human beings. At first, we were planning to do it all with the CnC but due to the limit of material available we decided to do the top part laser cut in plywood.

Once that it was printed we had to reduce the size of average 20cm ish, fortunately we designed the botton part so that I could be shorten up.

Then we tried to put them together and decided to 3D print support pieces for the screws.

Isolation: in order to make the structure more isolating, since that the top part is made with 4mm plywood, we decided to cover it with a isolating texture.

# **RASPBERRY PI**

Material needed: 

- raspberyy pi
- breadboard
- USB microphone
- 3 330 Ohm resistors
